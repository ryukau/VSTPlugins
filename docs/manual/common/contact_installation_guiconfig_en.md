## Installation
### Plugin
Move `*.vst3` directory to:

- `/Program Files/Common Files/VST3/` for Windows.
- `$HOME/.vst3/` for Linux.
- `/Users/$USERNAME/Library/Audio/Plug-ins/VST3/` for macOS.

DAW may provides additional VST3 directory. For more information, please refer to the manual of the DAW.

### Presets
**Notice**: Some plugins don't have presets provided by Uhhyou Plugins.

Presets are included in the plugin package linked at the top of this page. To install presets, follow the steps below.

1. Download plugin from a link at the top of this page.
2. Extract downloaded zip file.
3. Open `presets` directory placed in extracted package.
4. Move `Uhhyou` directory into an OS specific preset directory (see below).

Below is a list of preset directories for each OS.

- Windows : `/Users/$USERNAME/Documents/VST3 Presets`
- Linux : `$HOME/.vst3/presets`
- macOS : `/Users/$USERNAME/Library/Audio/Presets`

Preset directory name must be the same as the plugin. If preset directory does not exist, create it.

- [Preset Locations - VST 3 Developer Portal](https://steinbergmedia.github.io/vst3_dev_portal/pages/Technical+Documentation/Locations+Format/Preset+Locations.html)

### Windows Specific
If DAW doesn't recognize the plugin, try installing C++ redistributable (`vc_redist.x64.exe`). Installer can be found in the link below.

- [Latest supported Visual C++ Redistributable downloads | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170#latest-microsoft-visual-c-redistributable-version)

### Linux Specific
On Ubuntu 24.04, those packages are required.

```bash
sudo apt install libxcb-cursor0  libxkbcommon-x11-0
```

If DAW doesn't recognize the plugin, take a look at `Package Requirements` section of the link below and make sure all the VST3 related package is installed.

- [VSTGUI: Setup](https://steinbergmedia.github.io/vst3_doc/vstgui/html/page_setup.html)

REAPER on Linux may not recognize the plugin. A workaround is to delete a file `~/.config/REAPER/reaper-vstplugins64.ini` and restart REAPER.

### macOS Specific
**Important**: `full` package is not confirmed working. When using `full`, try removing following files.

- `Contents/Resources/Documentation`
- `Contents/x86_64-linux`
- `Contents/x86_64-win`

`macOS` package doesn't contain above files. Also, all packages are in "ad-hoc signing" state set by `codesign` command.

#### Remove Quarantine
When trying to run plugin first time, following message may appear on macOS.

```
<PluginName>.vst3 is damaged and can't be opened. You should move it to the Trash.
```

In this case, open terminal and try running one or both of following command to unzipped `.vst3` directory. Replace `/path/to/PluginName.vst3` according to your install location.

```sh
xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /path/to/PluginName.vst3
xattr -rc /path/to/PluginName.vst3
```

#### Bypass Gatekeeper
Plugin may be considered as unsigned/un-notarized application. In this case, open System Preferences, go to Security & Privacy → General, then click the Open Anyway button. The offcial Apple help page linked below has screenshots for the procedure. See "If you want to open an app that hasn’t been notarized or is from an unidentified developer" section.

- [Safely open apps on your Mac - Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491)

If the plugin is still not working, try changing install location to `/Library/Audio/Plug-ins/VST3/` or `/Users/$USERNAME/Library/Audio/Plug-ins/VST3/` whichever still haven't tried.

If all the above methods do not work, try following the steps below.

1. Open terminal and run `sudo spctl --master-disable`.
2. Go to System Preferences → Security and Privacy → General → Allow apps downloaded from, then select "Anywhere".

Beware that steps above degrades security of your system. To revert the settings, follow the steps below.

1. Go to System Preferences → Security and Privacy → General → Allow apps downloaded from, then select option to "App Store and identified developers".
2. Open terminal and run `sudo spctl --master-enable`.

#### Applying `codesign`
**Note** This section may not relevant to `macOS` packages. However it's not verified. ([GitHub issue](https://github.com/ryukau/VSTPlugins/issues/27))

To use `full` package, following command might be used.

```sh
sudo codesign --force --deep -s - /path/to/PluginName.vst3
```

`codesign` might not be available without installing [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).

## GUI Style Configuration
At first time, create color config file to:

- `/Users/USERNAME/AppData/Roaming/UhhyouPlugins/style/style.json` on Windows.
- `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/UhhyouPlugins/style/style.json` on Linux.
  - If `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is empty, make `$HOME/.config/UhhyouPlugins/style/style.json`.
- `/Users/$USERNAME/Library/Preferences/UhhyouPlugins/style/style.json` on macOS.

`style.json` will be loaded for each time a plugin window opens.

Several color themes are available on the link below. To use, copy the text to `style.json`.

- [VSTPlugins/package/style/themes at master · ryukau/VSTPlugins](https://github.com/ryukau/VSTPlugins/tree/master/package/style/themes)

Below is an example of `style.json`.

```json
{
  "guiScale"          : 1          ,
  "fontFamily"        : "Tinos"    ,
  "fontBold"          : true       ,
  "fontItalic"        : true       ,
  "foreground"        : "#000000"  ,
  "foregroundButtonOn": "#000000"  ,
  "foregroundInactive": "#8a8a8a"  ,
  "background"        : "#ffffff"  ,
  "boxBackground"     : "#ffffff"  ,
  "border"            : "#000000"  ,
  "borderCheckbox"    : "#000000"  ,
  "borderLabel"       : "#000000"  ,
  "unfocused"         : "#dddddd"  ,
  "highlightMain"     : "#0ba4f1"  ,
  "highlightAccent"   : "#13c136"  ,
  "highlightButton"   : "#fcc04f"  ,
  "highlightWarning"  : "#fc8080"  ,
  "overlay"           : "#00000088",
  "overlayHighlight"  : "#00ff0033"
}
```

### GUI Scale
- `guiScale`: GUI scaling. For example, `0.75` is 75%, and `2.0` is 200%.

The minimum of `guiScale` is `0.01`. The maximum is practically non-existent (the max value of 64-bit float).

**Notice**: If `guiScale` is too large, DAW may place the "close" button on the plugin window out of screen, making it unclickable.

### Font Options
Following is a list of font options.

- `fontFamily`: Font family name.
- `fontBold`: Enable **bold** style when `true`, disable when `false`.
- `fontItalic`: Enable *italic* style when `true`, disable when `false`.

System font can be used as `fontFamily`. To use different fonts for different plugins, place `*.ttf` file into custom font path: `*.vst3/Contents/Resources/Fonts`.

**Notice**: If the combination of `fontFamily`, `fontBold`, `fontItalic` does not exist in custom font path, default font of VSTGUI is used.

If `fontFamily` is set to empty string `""`, then [`"Tinos"`](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Tinos) is used as fallback. If the length is greater than 1 and the font family name doesn't exist, default font of VSTGUI is used.

Styles other than bold, italic or bold-italic are not supported by VSTGUI. For example, "Thin", "Light", "Medium", and "Black" weights cannot be used.

### Color Options
Hex color codes are used.

- 6 digit color is RGB.
- 8 digit color is RGBA.

First letter `#` is conventional. Plugins ignore the first letter of color code, thus `?102938`, `\n11335577` are valid.

Do not use characters outside of `0-9a-f` for color value.

Following is a list of color options. If an option is missing, default color will be used.

- `foreground`: Text color.
- `foregroundButtonOn`: Text color of active toggle button. Recommend to use the same value of `foreground` or `boxBackground`.
- `foregroundInactive`: Text color of inactive components. Currently, only used for TabView.
- `background`: Background color.
- `boxBackground`: Background color of inside of box shaped components (Barbox, Button, Checkbox, OptionMenu, TextKnob, VSlider).
- `border`: Border color of box shaped components.
- `borderCheckbox`: Border color of CheckBox.
- `borderLabel`: Line color of parameter section label.
- `unfocused`: Color to fill unfocused components. Currently, only used for knobs.
- `highlightMain`: Color to indicate focus is on a component. Highlight colors are also used for value of slider components (BarBox and VSlider).
- `highlightAccent`: Same as `highlightMain`. Used for cosmetics.
- `highlightButton`: Color to indicate focus is on a button.
- `highlightWarning`: Same as `highlightMain`, but only used for parameters which requires extra caution.
- `overlay`: Overlay color. Used to overlay texts and indicators.
- `overlayHighlight`: Overlay color to highlight current focus.
