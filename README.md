# Uhhyou Plugins VST 3
This repository is publishing VST 3 plugins under GPLv3.

- [Uhhyou Plugins (Documentation)](https://ryukau.github.io/VSTPlugins/)

The plugins are available at [release page](https://github.com/ryukau/VSTPlugins/releases). To install from a zip package, refer to [a section on the manual](https://ryukau.github.io/VSTPlugins/manual/SevenDelay/SevenDelay_en.html#installation).

- `UhhyouPlugins*.zip` contains everything. (`*` is a wildcard character.)
- Other zip files are individual plugins.

## Status
- Windows: It works.
- macOS: It worked on Sequoia (version 15). It probably won't work on older OS version as is.
- Linux: DSP part works, but GUI isn't working.
